# Scenario
1. Create an interface named Chassis. Add the following to the interface:
• A public constant string named chassis with a value of “Chassis”.
• The definition of a public getChassisType method that returns an instance of Chassis.
• The definition of a public setChassisType that accepts a string named vehicleChassis and returns a void.
2. Create an interface Engine with the following list of public method definitions that return a void:
setEngineCylinders(int engineCylinders);
setEngineManufacturedDate(Date date);
setEngineManufacturer(String manufacturer);
setEngineMake(String engineMake);
setEngineModel(String engineModel);
setDriveTrain(String driveTrain);
setEngineType(String fuel);
3. Create a concrete class named VehicleChassis that implements the interface Chassis with the following:
• Create a String named chassisName instance variable.
• A public default constructor and an overloaded constructor with the following value:
A String with a parameter value of chassisName
• Set the chassisName instance variable in both, use the interface constant as the default String value.
• A public method named getChassisType that doesnt have a formal parameter and that returns an instance
of the interface Chassis (hint that would be a copy of this class).
• A public method setChassisType that takes a String parameter vehicleChassis and that returns a void. It
should set the instance variable chassisName.
• A public toString method that returns the following:
Chassis Name : Chassis
• Write a static main method that creates two objects, one with the default constructor and the other with the
constructor with parameters. Give sample data for the parameters.
4. Create a concrete class named VehicleFrame that implements the interface Chassis with the following:
• Create a String named vehicleFrameType instance variable.
• A public default constructor and an overloaded constructor with the following value:
A String with a parameter value of vehicleFrameType
• Set the vehicleFrameType instance variable in both, use “Unibody” as the default String value.
• A public method named getChassisType that didn't have a formal parameter and that returns an instance
of the interface Chassis (hint that would be a copy of this class).
• A public method setChassisType that takes a String parameter vehicleFrameType and that returns a void.
It should set the instance variable vehicleFrameType.
• A public toString method that returns the following:
Chassis : Chassis
Vehicle Frame : Unibody
• Write a static main method that tests two scenarios:
1. One that prints all fuel grade values, like:
Chassis : Chassis
Vehicle Frame : Unibody
2. One that prints a value set by a single string value.
Vehicle Frame : Ladder Frame
5. Create a concrete class named ManufacturedEngine that implements the interface Engine with the following:

literal values.
• A public overloaded constructor with values for all of the variables defined above.
• A public method implementations for all of the public methods found in the Engine interface.
• A public toString method that returns the following:
Engine Manufacturer : Generic
Engine Manufactured : Thu Feb 02 00:55:44 MST 2012
Engine Make : Generic
Engine Model : Generic
Engine Type : 85 AKI
Engine Cylinders : 0
Drive Train : 2WD: Two-Wheel Drives
• Write a static main method that tests two scenarios:
• One that prints a generic set of strings, like:
Engine Manufacturer : Generic
Engine Manufactured : Thu Feb 02 00:55:44 MST 2012
Engine Make : Generic
Engine Model : Generic
Engine Type : 85 AKI
Engine Cylinders : 0
Drive Train : 2WD: Two-Wheel Drive
• One that accepts call parameters and returns the following:
Engine Manufacturer : Honda
Engine Manufactured : Tue Jan 03 07:13:19 MST 2012
Engine Make : H-Series
Engine Model : H23A1
Engine Type : 88 AKI
Engine Cylinders : 4
Drive Train : 2WD: Two-Wheel Drive
6. Create an interface Feature with the following method definitions:
public String getFeature();
public void setFeature(String feature);
7. Create a concrete class named InteriorFeature that implements the interface Feature with the following:
• Create a String named interiorFeature as an instance variable.
• A public default constructor without parameters that sets the interiorFeature instance variable to “Generic”.
• An overloaded constructor with the following value:
A String with a parameter value of interiorFeature
• Set the interiorFeature instance variable to the parameter interiorFeature.
• A public method named getFeature that doesnt have a formal parameter and that returns an instance of
String.
• A public method setFeature that takes a String parameter interiorFeature and that returns a void. It should
set the instance variable interiorFeature.
• A public toString method that returns the following:
Interior [Generic]
• Write a static main method that tests two scenarios:
• One that prints all fuel grade values, like:
Interior [Generic]
Another like
Interior [Climate Control]
8. Create a concrete class named ExteriorFeature that implements the interface Feature with the following:
• Create a String named exteriorFeature as an instance variable.
• A public default constructor without parameters that sets the exteriorFeature instance variable.
• An overloaded constructor with the following value:
A String with a parameter value of exteriorFeature
• Set the exteriorFeature instance variable in both, use features as String values.
• A public method named getFeature that doesnt have a formal parameter and that returns an instance of
String.
• A public method setFeature that takes a String parameter exteriorFeature and that returns a void. It should
set the instance variable exteriorFeature.
